      <p>
         I am a Data Science student at the University of Canterbury, with solid skills in Python programming, statistics, and analyzing data. Through my studies, I have worked on projects involving algorithms, data visualization, and statistical models. These experiences have taught me how to take raw information and turn it into clear insights that can help make better decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
         I am particularly interested in applying data science to solve practical problems in areas like energy, finance, sustainability, and customer service. I enjoy finding patterns in data that can lead to improvements or solutions. I am looking for internship opportunities where I can continue to build my skills while contributing to real-world, data-driven projects.
      </p>
      <p>
         My main focus is on exploring fields like Artificial Intelligence, Data Analysis, and Data Engineering. I enjoy working with others, learning new methods, and applying my knowledge in ways that have a positive impact. I am eager to keep improving and to use data science to make a meaningful difference.
