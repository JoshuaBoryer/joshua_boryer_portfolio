   <p class="tagline">Data Science student exploring ideas</p>
   <p> 
      I’m a Data Science student at the University of Canterbury with a strong foundation in Python programming, statistics, and data analysis. 
      Through my coursework in algorithms, data analysis, data visualisation, and statistical modelling I’ve gained practical experience in transforming raw data into meaningful insights.
      I have a particular interest in solving real world problems across industries like energy, finance, sustainability, and customer services. 
      Currently seeking internship opportunities where I can grow my skills and contribute to impactful, data driven projects.
      I'm especially keen to explore the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Data Analysis, and Data Engineering with an eagersness to collaborate, keep learning, and apply data science in ways that make a real difference.
