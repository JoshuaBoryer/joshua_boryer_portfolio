        Hi, I’m Joshua.
        I grew up in Nelson and I’m currently studying data science but more than anything I’m focused on becoming the best version of myself every day. 
        To me that means being a little more productive, a little more educated, or even just having better interactions than the day before. 
        Kindness and honesty are values I hold close and I try to bring that energy into everything I do.
      </p>
     <p>
       My friends would describe me as energetic and fun, and I think that shows in the things I love. 
       Music is a big part of my life. I play guitar, piano, and drums, and I enjoy experimenting with sounds and performing. 
       I’ve even busked on the streets and played in front of hundreds of people in competitions which taught me how to put myself out there and connect with others.
       Sports are another big passion of mine. Whether it’s basketball or football I play for the competition, fitness, and fun all at once. 
       Being competitive drives me to push myself but it’s also about teamwork and learning from every game. 
       I balance that with time outdoors hiking and soaking up the peace that comes with being in nature. The gym and an active lifestyle keep me moving and motivated.
     <p>
       I’ve always had a curious and adventurous outlook which is why travel is something I want to explore more in the future. 
       The idea of experiencing new cultures and people excites me and I’d love to one day get completely culture shocked and broaden the way I see the world.
     </p>
