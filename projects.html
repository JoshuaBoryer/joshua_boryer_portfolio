          In this analysis of Houston Rockets Players, I found data on NBA statistics websites and manipulated it to get findings.
          This project used statistics from the 24/25 season and compared it with salaries projected for the 25/26 season.

                 In this project, I explored a wind dataset using R. 
                 I calculated key statistics like average and maximum wind speeds, examined wind directions, and visualized relationships between wind speed and temperature. 
                 This assignment helped me practice data analysis, plotting, and interpreting trends in a clear and efficient way.

                 In this project, I analyzed two datasets using R to understand relationships between variables and make predictions. 
                 Chemical Reaction Dataset: I explored how the mass of a chemical changes over time. Using graphs and linear regression, I found a clear positive relationship as the reaction time increases, the mass also increases. 
                 I checked the model assumptions and predicted the mass at different time points.
                 Forest Dataset: I compared light levels in Broadleaf and Conifer forests. 
                 The analysis showed that Broadleaf forests receive more light, and light decreases as distance from the canopy increases. 
                 I created a simple linear model to summarize these findings and make predictions.

                 In this project, I explored a dataset to understand what affects the risk of infection. 
                 Using R, I analyzed relationships between patient stay length, number of X-rays, age, and infection risk. 
                 I built a linear regression model and found that longer hospital stays and more X-rays increase the risk of infection, while age had no significant effect.

                 In this assignment, I analyzed two datasets using R.
                 Air Pollution: I compared air pollution levels across four regions (A, B, C, D) using boxplots and ANOVA tests. 
                 Results showed that regions C and D had significantly lower air pollution than A and B, while B and A were not statistically different. 
                 Residual analysis confirmed that the linear model assumptions were satisfied.
                 Grass Growth: I examined how sunlight and watering frequency affect grass height. 
                 Linear models and ANOVA tests showed that sunlight significantly influences grass height, while watering frequency has little effect. 
                 Tukey’s HSD test confirmed which sunlight levels led to taller grass, highlighting moderate sunlight as the most effective.
                 This assignment helped me practice using R for data visualization, hypothesis testing, linear modeling, and interpreting results.

                 Retail Training & Customer Issues.
                 This project analyzed whether training mode (in-store vs online) affects the number of customer issues resolved by employees. 
                 Using linear mixed models, I found that online training significantly increases the number of issues resolved. 
                 Variance between stores was also significant, confirming that store-specific factors influence outcomes. 
                 Residuals met assumptions of normality and constant variance, making the model reliable.
                 Light Intensity & Lily Growth I investigated whether light intensity affects lily height increase across different genotypes. 
                 Scatterplots and linear mixed models showed no significant effect of light intensity on growth. 
                 Residuals followed normal distribution and showed constant variance, confirming model assumptions. 
                 The results suggest genotype, rather than light intensity, is the main factor influencing height increase.

                 I analyzed factors affecting social media engagement and cardiovascular fitness over time. 
                 For social media engagement, I examined how fashion type (fast or sustainable), post type (text, image, video), and platform (Social Media A–G) influence engagement. 
                 Using a linear mixed model with random intercepts and slopes for post type nested within platform, I found that sustainable fashion generally generates higher engagement than fast fashion, with the most engaging post type varying by platform.
                 Video performs best on some platforms, text on others, and images on a few. For cardiovascular fitness, I tracked VO2max over 16 weeks, treating individuals and weeks as factors in linear mixed models.
                 The analysis showed that VO2max increases over time, though individuals differ in baseline fitness and improvement rates. 
                 Correlations indicate consistent progress in later weeks, confirming that both baseline differences and individual response rates are important factors in fitness improvements.

                 I used principal component analysis (PCA) to explore energy and population datasets. 
                 For the energy data, Submetering1 and Submetering3, and Submetering2 and Submetering3, showed moderate correlations, while GlobalActivePower and GlobalIntensity were strongly correlated.
                 Scaling the variables allowed PCA to reveal that GlobalReactivePower and Submetering3 were best represented by the first two components, with six components explaining 99% of the variance. 
                 For the population data, after removing non-informative variables, PC1 captured age and growth differences, while PC2 reflected population density. 
                 Cluster 2 countries had higher growth and younger populations, whereas Cluster 4 were more urbanized with older populations. 
                 PCA effectively highlighted key patterns and reduced complexity in both datasets.

                 I performed k-means clustering and classification analysis on two datasets. 
                 For the ionosphere data, all variables were numerical and scaled to equalize units. 
                 Using the elbow method, I initially chose four clusters, but after observing overlapping clusters, I adjusted to three, which produced a clearer separation.
                 The first principal component alone was insufficient to separate the clusters, as separation depended on both the first and second components. 
                 Setting a random seed ensured reproducible clustering results. 
                 Cluster 3 had the highest average pulse number (V13) at 0.7. For the appendicitis dataset, the outcome variable was converted to a factor with "appendicitis" as the positive outcome. 
                 A logistic regression model achieved a misclassification error of 7.7%, while cross-validation reflected a more accurate prediction error of 5.8%. A decision tree predicted no appendicitis for a patient with low risk scores, and a random forest with 1,000 trees confirmed that 200 trees were sufficient for stable error rates. 
                 The random forest model had perfect classification on the training data, demonstrating the highest area under the curve and best performance.
